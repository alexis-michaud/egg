%% <peakdet_inter> 
%% Software for the semi-automatic analysis of the electroglottographic signal
% This script is for the analysis of a set of continuously voiced items:
% for example, vowels, syllable rhymes, or sustained voiced sounds.
%
% A version of <peakdet> is hosted in the COVAREP repository. Following
% COVAREP's principles, that version is written as a function taking a
% signal as input, without a user interface. 
% ( https://github.com/covarep/covarep/tree/master/glottalsource/egg/peakdet )
% 
% The present version, by contrast, takes as input a list of regions to analyze
% and incorporates a (simple) display for verification of the results by the user. 
% This script is called <peakdet_inter>, where 'inter' stands for 'interface'.
% 
%% Input files
% To run <peakdet_inter> you need to prepare two files:
% (i) an EGG signal: either as a MONO wav file, or in the right channel of a
% STEREO wav file. Any sampling rate is possible. A high sampling frequency
% (44,100 Hz or higher) is recommended, so as to be able to look at fine
% phonetic detail concerning the opening and closing peaks on the
% derivative of the EGG signal
% (ii) a file containing the information concerning the beginning and end of
% each item. This script was originally designed for reading a .txt file
% containing a list of Regions created with the software SoundForge, as below: 
% Name                                  In           Out      Duration
% -------------------------- ------------- ------------- -------------
% 1                        00:00:03,273  00:00:03,363  00:00:00,090
% 2                        00:00:03,388  00:00:03,490  00:00:00,102
% where "1" and "2" are labels chosen by the user, and the times are given
% as: hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds.
%
%  This script was devised for *spoken* materials, as opposed to *sung* materials:
%  it was found that Nathalie Henrich's <decom.m> MatLab function, devised for
%  the singing voice, did not yield results for speech data because
%  the EGG signal failed to meet the criterion for quasi-periodicity. Hence the
%  decision to develop a new function, which, like <decom.m>, detects closing
%  peaks and opening peaks on the derivative of the EGG signal, but by a
%  *threshold* method and not by autocorrelation [1, 2].
%
%% Parameters
% Some parameters need to be set for the analysis. They are set within the
% script. It is also possible to uncomment lines 169 to 190 in the script:
% the user will then be asked to provide values for various parameters. 
% This option was the default in version 1. For heavy-duty use, this had
% the drawback of requiring the user to input the same information time and
% again (every time the script was run). So, in the current version
% (version 2), values are set inside the script.
% (1) <resampC>: coefficient for resampling peaks to a higher sampling rate
% The electroglottographic signal is reinterpolated at the closing and opening
% peaks for accurate peak detection. The coefficient for reinterpolation is
% set at 100 by default; this variable, <resampC>, can be modified by the user, 
% to define it as a function of the sampling frequency of the original signal, 
% or in relation to the fundamental frequency of the sample under analysis.
%
% (2) <MaxPerN>: number of maximum glottal cycles per token
% The script processes tokens one by one and places results for each token
% in a separate sheet in a three-dimensional matrix. Each token can contain
% up to <MaxPerN> glottal cycles, i.e. each sheet in the matrix has
% <MaxPerN> lines. The value of <MaxPerN> is set at 100 by default; it can be modified inside the script.
%
% (3) <maxF>: maximum f0. 
% To avoid absurd results in the case of double
% closing peaks, a threshold on maximum fundamental frequency is set by the
% user, and peaks that are so close that the corresponding f0 is above this
% threshold are considered as belonging in the same "peak cluster". This
% value is set at 500 to start with. 
% In light of the great differences in f0 range across speakers and across the
% experimental tasks that they perform, it is not adequate to leave this
% unchanged for all speakers: the user should consider modifying the threshold.
% It was not found useful to set a lower threshold parallel to this upper
% threshold. Implausibly low values in the results point to one of the following
% situations :
%  - One closing peak has been detected before the onset of voicing or after the
%    offset of voicing, resulting in the detection of a ‘period’ the inverse of
%    which is under 20 Hz. These cases can be corrected by suppressing the first
%    or last glottal cycle ; this option is offered by the program, at the stage where
%    the user is asked to check the results.
%  - Some closing peaks within a voiced portion of signal have gone undetected
%    because their amplitude is below the threshold. The user must then check on
%    the figure which amplitude threshold is to be chosen for all the peaks to
%    be detected, and set the amplitude threshold accordingly ; this option is
%    offered by the program when the user is asked to confirm the results.
%
% (4) <method>: choice of method chosen to handle double closing peaks in f0 calculation:
% if <method == 0>: selecting highest of the peaks
% if <method == 1>: selecting first peak
% if <method == 2>: selecting last peak
% if <method == 3>: using barycentre method
% if <method == 4>: exclude all double peaks
%
% (5) <smoothingstep>: number of data points (to the left and right) for smoothing of the dEGG
% signal: a value of 1 means 1 point to the left and 1 to the right (i.e. a
% total of 3 points), and so on.

% Version 2 released in January 2019. New to version 2.0 of the front-end:
% the choice of colours for the display of results is more meaningful.
% Improvements to the back-end can be tracked on the COVAREP repository: 
% briefly, as compared with version 1, the function for smoothing the
% signal was changed to a linearly weighted symmetric moving average,
% following the example of <praatdet> (at https://github.com/kirbyj/praatdet#smoothing ), 
% and the threshold for detection of closing peaks is lowered from one
% fourth of the highest closing peak to one-twelfth, so as not to leave
% small closing peaks (typically found in creaky voice) undetected.
