for i = 2 : length(dSIG) - 1
    % The original programme detected any crossing of the threshold by the
    % following lines:
%     if and (dSIG(i) > thresh, dSIG(i + 1) <= thresh)
%        nbr = nbr + 1;
%        rims(nbr,1) = i ; 
%     end
%     if and (dSIG(i) < thresh, dSIG(i + 1) >= thresh)
%         nbl = nbl + 1;
%         rims(nbl,2) = i ; 
%     end
    % This method resulted in erroneous detections in the frequent cases where
    % there was a dent in the signal precisely at the threshold value. 
    % One solution envisaged consisted in adding a condition on the six
    % surrounding points (three to the left and right), to ensure that the point
    % in question is actually a crossing, not simply a dent in the signal. The
    % commands were as follow:
%     % Calculation of truth values for 3 points in succession, yielding a vector of three truth values
%     DECREASE_TRUTH = (dSIG(i - 2:i) >= thresh) & (dSIG(i + 1:i + 3) < thresh);
%     % Condition: if all three propositions are true (i.e. if their mean is 1),
%     % this is a down-crossing.
%     if mean(DECREASE_TRUTH) == 1
%         nbr = nbr + 1;
%         rims(nbr,2) = i ; 
%     end
%     % Same procedure for up-crossings.
%     INCREASE_TRUTH = (dSIG(i - 2:i) <= thresh) & (dSIG(i + 1:i + 3) > thresh);
%     if mean(INCREASE_TRUTH) == 1
%         nbl = nbl + 1;
%         rims(nbl,1) = i ; 
%     end
    % This condition, however, is too strong: at the point of crossing, there
    % may be dents in the signal, resulting in the crossing not being detected,
    % e.g. if there are "double crossings", so that no crossing was detected for
    % large stretches of the signal. The solution chosen is therefore to detect
    % all crossings, as in the first solution, only excluding "false crossings":
    % points where the limit is reached but not actually crossed, i.e. sequences
    % such as: 
    % threshold+3      threshold       threshold+1
    % or: 
    % threshold-3      threshold       threshold-1 :
    if (dSIG(i - 1) <= thresh) & (dSIG(i) <= thresh) & (dSIG(i + 1) > thresh)
        % (detection of an up-crossing)
        nbl = nbl + 1;
        rims(nbl,1) = i ; 
    end
    if (dSIG(i - 1) > thresh) & (dSIG(i) <= thresh) & (dSIG(i + 1) <= thresh)
       % (detection of a down-crossing)
       nbr = nbr + 1;
       rims(nbr,2) = i; 
    end
    % In case of successive values equal to the threshold: if they result from 
    % a decrease in the signal, a crossing is detected, both up and down; if
    % they result from an increase, no crossing is detected.
    % For example, if the threshold is 10: the
    % sequence 14 10 10 12 will be analyzed as: crossing-down at index 2,
    % crossing-up at index 3. The sequence 9 10 10 8 will be analyzed as: no
    % crossing at all (due to the > condition). This is of no consequence in the
    % results.
