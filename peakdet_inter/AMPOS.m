function [TGEI,valid,validtime,numberofpeaks] = AMPOS(SIG,rims,resampC,Ts,method,propthresh)
%%%%%%%%% Input to AMPOS (= variables that are passed on to AMPOS):
% - <SIG>: the original EGG signal
% - <rims>: indices of beginning and end of detected peaks; created by function
% RIM
% - <resampC> : coefficient for resampling: e.g., if resampC is set at 100, the
% programme will interpolate 100 times more points than there were in the
% original signal, simulating a sampling frequency 100 times higher than that
% actually used: e.g. from 44,100 Hz to an equivalent of 4,410,000 Hz.
% - <Ts>: inverse of sampling frequency: sampling period.
% - <method>: indication on the method which is to be used in the handling of 
% double / multiple peaks: selecting the first or the highest or using a
% barycentre method, etc.
% - <propthresh> : threshold for exclusion of small peaks; used only for
% glottis closures: for openings, the period is known already, and the threshold
% set at a certain height of the maximum of the signal within the period, earlier on
% in the calculations.
%
%%%%%%%%% Output of AMPOS:
% <TGEI>: times of Glottal-Event Instants: 
% 3-column matrix containing: index, amplitude, and time (in ms) of
% detected closings, following the method specified by the user for the
% approximation of Fo: in case of double peaks, the user specified (in <method>)
% selection of the first peak or of the highest peak, etc. It is not called TGCI
% (Time of Glottis-Closure Instants) but only TGEI (Time of Glottal-Event
% Instant) because this function applies to opening instants as well.
% <valid>: created by PEAKSHAPE: provides an indication on the relative heights
% of the two highest summits within the peak.
% This function reinterpolates the original EGG signal to obtain a very accurate
% measurement of the amplitude of the peak. This follows advice given by Wolfgang Hess, 
% Univ. of Bonn, during discussions on the amplitude of the peak of the derivative
% at closure (DECPA) at the Speech Prosody 2004 conference, Nara, Japan. In the
% case of opening peaks, reinterpolation is not recommended, unless perhaps when visual
% observation shows exceptionally clear, unique opening peaks.
